Assignment Four

File: README.md main.cpp makeList.h makeQueue.h

References:
Audrey Bichelmeir: She helped me out a lot with this project, she also helped me understand the prompt
How to read a file: http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/
I also very closely followed the class examples for how to build list nodes, how to build a 2d list, and how to build a queue from class

Running instructions: g++ main.cpp -o a.out ./a.out

Problems: Everything, I was having a hard time understanding the prompt, so far the only thing it is able to do is to read a file. I tried to follow the in class examples but it was not working out for me so I commented everything out except for what worked. As you can see from my comments I tried to use the in class examples.
